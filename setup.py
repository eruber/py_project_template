    # Run-time Dependencies
    # Specify what dependencies are minimally needed to run. When the project
    # is installed by pip, this is the specification that is used to install
    # its dependencies. For more details, see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#install-requires
    # https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/
    install_requires=[],

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). You can install these using the following syntax,
    # for example:
    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    extras_require={
        # 'dev': ['check-manifest'],
        # 'test': ['coverage'],
    },

    # To install additional data files INTERNAL to a package, use this directive.
    # These files are often data that’s closely related to the package’s
    # implementation, or text files containing documentation that might be of
    # interest to programmers using the package. These files are called
    # “package data”.
    #
    # The value must be a mapping from package name to a list of relative path
    # names that should be copied into the package. The paths are interpreted
    # as relative to the directory containing the package.
    #
    # For more details, see:
    #  https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#including-data-files
    package_data={
        # 'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    },

    # To install additonal data files OUTSIDE of a package, use this directive.
    # Although configuring package_data above is sufficient for most needs,
    # in some cases you may need to place data files OUTSIDE of the package.
    #
    # Each (directory, files) pair in the sequence specifies the installation
    # directory and the files to install there. If directory is a relative
    # path, it is interpreted relative to the installation prefix
    # (Python’s sys.prefix for pure-Python distributions, sys.exec_prefix for
    # distributions that contain extension modules). Each file name in files
    # is interpreted relative to the setup.py script at the top of the project
    # source distribution.

    # https://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
